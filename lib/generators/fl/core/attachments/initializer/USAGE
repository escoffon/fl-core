Description:
  This generator installs a template initializer that contains configuration options for standard
  attachment types. This initializer will likely need to be modified to meet the needs of the
  application, but it can be used as a reasonable starting point.

Arguments:
  No arguments.

Example:
  rails generate fl:core:attachments:initializer

  The generator will create:
    config/initializers/attachment_types.rb (if it does not exist already)
