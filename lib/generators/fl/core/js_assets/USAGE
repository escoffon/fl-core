Description:
  This generator installs the Javascript core assets into vendor/javascript.
  Since webpacker does not support accessing assets outside of the
  directory structure of the Rails application, you have to copy those files over.

  The generator also installs a starter documentation configuration directory and
  the necessary Yarn package references.

  It takes one optional flag:
    --nodoc    If present, the documentation configuration is not created.
               By default, the documentation configuration is created.

  For example, given this command:
    rails generate fl:core:js_assets
  The generator will create:
    vendor/javascript/fl/core
  as a copy of app/javascript/fl/core in the gem.

  It will also create a package.json file, or modify an existing one, to register
  Yarn packages used by the Javascript assets (many of which are used by the
  documentation system).

  Finally, unless the --nodoc flag is given, a default configuration file is
  created in
    doc/dgeni/conf.js
  Template API and Guide content files are created under
    doc/dgeni/contents
  And a Gulp driver file
    gulpfile.js
  is created in the app's root directory. Running the Gulp tool generates
  documentation in
    public/doc/js
  that documents the assets that were installed above, and any other sources in
    app/javascript
  (You can modify much of this behavior by editing the conf.js file.)
  A driver script for the documentation system is placed in
    scripts/docs_js.sh
  that wraps the call to Gulp after the documentation directory is cleared.
