Following the general structure outlined in https://toddmotto.com/documenting-angular-dgeni

Install Node.js packages:

- dgeni-packages (which picks up dgeni)
- gulp (for running DGeni)
- del (used by the cleanup task in gulp)
- run-sequence (used by the gulp file)

conf-sample.js is the configuration file to run the sample doc files (in ~/src/sampledoc).

The Gulp file in ~/gulpfile.js has targets for running various documentation sets.

You may have to use <pre> to inline examples in documentation sections.
The implementation of markdown does not seem to understand indents as code areas at times; it's not
clear that causes it to get confused, but some indents are recognized, and some are not.
